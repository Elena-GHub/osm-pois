## UPOI site migration to Django app
This is a shared project between [EllaQu√≠mica](https://github.com/EllaQuimica) & [Elena C.](https://github.com/Elena-GHub)
It is part of our learning journey, with mentoring by the original author [humitos](https://elblogdehumitos.com).  
The aim is to bring the UPOI app, which is already up and running, to a more customisable solution for its users.  
### Tech setup
- Django 3.1.4
- Python 3.9
  

#  From the original Readme:
# osm-pois
